        Portland, Oregon
    </h1>
    <p>
        I love Portland, Oregon because of it's lush green color that exists year-round due to evergreen trees and an
        insane amount of rain nearly all year long. Additionally, Portland is beautiful because it has a backdrop of
        rolling hills and Mt. Hood.

        The Portland Oregon Temple is my favorite temple and it is located just south of Portland, Oregon. The Portland
        Temple holds a special place in my heart because that is where I was sealed to my wonderful spouse 19 years ago.
