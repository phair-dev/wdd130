			I am originally from Portland, Oregon, and I enjoy most are board games and travel. Family is also a big
			part of who I am, and I value the time I get to spend with my wife and 5 kids, whether it's sharing everyday
			moments or creating lasting memories together.

			Living in north Texas offers a unique blend of big city energy and southern charm. The area is known for its
			vibrant arts and music scene, world class sports, and a wide variety of food that reflects both traditional
			Texas flavors and international influences. It is a place where modern skyscrapers meet historic
			neighborhoods, and where community pride runs deep. The warm climate and central location also make it a hub
			for travel, business, and culture.
